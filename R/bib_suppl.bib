  abstract = {Skip to Next Section The measurement of color in biology has become increasingly common. These measurements are not limited to color vision research, but are also found in studies of communication, signaling, camouflage, evolution and behavior, and in the examination of environmental, artificial and biogenic light. Although the recent availability of portable spectrometers has made it simpler to measure color, guidance on how to make these measurements has not kept pace. Because most biologists receive little training in optics, many measure the wrong thing, or measure the right thing in the wrong way. This Commentary attempts to give biologists a brief overview of how to measure light and color using spectrometers and calibrated photographs. It focuses in particular on the inherent ambiguities of many optical measurements, and how these can be addressed.},

  abstract = {Biological coloration presents a canvas for the study of ecological and evolutionary processes. Enduring interest in colour-based phenotypes has driven, and been driven by, improved techniques for quantifying colour patterns in ever-more relevant ways, yet the need for flexible, open frameworks for data processing and analysis persists. Here we introduce pavo 2, the latest iteration of the r package pavo. This release represents the extensive refinement and expansion of existing methods, as well as a suite of new tools for the cohesive analysis of the spectral and (now) spatial structure of colour patterns and perception. At its core, the package retains a broad focus on (a) the organization and processing of spectral and spatial data, and tools for the alternating (b) visualization, and (c) analysis of data. Significantly, pavo 2 introduces image-analysis capabilities, providing a cohesive workflow for the comprehensive analysis of colour patterns. We demonstrate the utility of pavo with a brief example centred on mimicry in Heliconius butterflies. Drawing on visual modelling, adjacency, and boundary strength analyses, we show that the combined spectral (colour and luminance) and spatial (pattern element distribution and boundary salience) features of putative models and mimics are closely aligned. pavo 2 offers a flexible and reproducible environment for the analysis of colour, with renewed potential to assist researchers in answering fundamental questions in sensory ecology and evolution.},

We propose Fiji as a platform for productive collaboration between computer science and biology research communities.},

Separation of juvenile year classes from size-frequency data is facilitated if shell diameters at the last winter growth break are also measured. Data from successive samples can then be combined. Adults can be aged for up to 5 yr after lip formation from a multiple regression relating age to percent periostracum wear and shell weight index. The growth patterns of C. hortensis and C. nemoralis are similar. Both take 3 yr for lip formation in Britain. The sub-adult phase of life, following lip formation, deserves further study.},
