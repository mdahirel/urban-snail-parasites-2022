# R outputs

This is where outputs from the R code (plots and models) are saved

Due to their size, saved models are not archived in the online version of this repository. However, they can be re-run and re-saved locally in under a few minutes each if needed. Saved copies **must** be present in here for the Supplementary Material pdf to be re-rendered correctly.
